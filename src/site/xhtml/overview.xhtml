	<h1>Overview</h1>

	<p>
		There are a few utility classes used by the ICAT core or by more than
		one component in the ICAT family. Classes are described in the <a
			href="apidocs/index.html">Javadoc.</a>
	</p>
	<p>In addition there is a small python library to be called by
		setup scripts. To do this requires some maven incantations to add the
		library to the component being deployed. See the pom.xml of any recent
		ICAT component to see how it can be done.</p>
